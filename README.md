## Introduction

This is a solver for [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

The goal is to make a bot that can beat most humans (on average).

## Setup

Install python3.

No dependencies yet, so no setup environment.

## Usage

To use the tool, run:
```sh
python ./src/wordle.py
```

Here's some example output:
```
> python ./src/wordle.py
Loaded 12972 words.
Round 1, guess: SEASE
Was it right? bbybb
Round 2, guess: RORAL
Was it right? bbbyb
Round 3, guess: NANNA
Was it right? bggbb
Round 4, guess: TANTY
Was it right? bggbb
Round 5, guess: MANIC
Was it right? bgggg
Round 6, guess: PANIC
Was it right? ggggg
Hooray!
```

You can also run in test mode to see how it performs for a specific word:
```
> python ./src/wordle.py -t panic
Loaded 12972 words.
Running test for word: PANIC
Round 1, guess: SEASE
